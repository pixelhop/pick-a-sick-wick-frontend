# Pick a Sick Wick

Here's a link to the shop that we've built, if you follow this series of blog posts this is what you'll also end up with [Pick a Sick Wick](https://pick-a-sick-wick.pixelhop.io/).

We've done our own designs for this little demo and they can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/mys8jJI7kb1gVhR43FqBWp/Pick-a-sick-wick?node-id=0%3A1), so as we take you through how to build this out, I will follow a design that we've done for this series.

This is the repo for the Nuxt 3 frontend and the Strapi 4 backend can be found here ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/pixelhop/pick-a-sick-wick-frontend](https://github.com/pixelhop/pick-a-sick-wick-frontend).

I can't tell you how excited we've been, waiting in anticipation for Nuxt 3 and Strapi 4 to come out, and now they're here, and we're ready to get our hands dirty and start using them straight away. I've always wanted to build an online candle shop, so I thought now's the time, and I can show you how to do it too, so let us go and Pick a Sick Wick.
